    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals with Muted Blue/Teal Accents -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is designed for optimal learning and knowledge testing, moving beyond the linear structure of the source report. It uses a tabbed navigation system to switch between four core, task-oriented sections: 1) A 'Dashboard' to immediately highlight critical recent updates for a renewal candidate. 2) A 'Study Guide' that breaks down the dense syllabus into digestible topics using interactive accordions. 3) An 'Interactive Practice Exam' to actively test knowledge with immediate feedback, scoring, and review capabilities. 4) A searchable 'Glossary' for quick reference. This structure was chosen because it separates learning modes (passive reading vs. active recall), reduces cognitive load by chunking information, and guides the user directly to the most important content (recent updates) for their specific situation (lapsed commission). -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report info is transformed for better usability. GOAL: Compare - The fee table is visualized as a Chart.js Bar Chart to make the proposed increase immediately apparent. GOAL: Organize - The syllabus is presented as interactive accordions to manage information density. Key updates are shown as distinct cards with icons for quick status recognition (effective vs. pending). GOAL: Test - The 100 practice questions are implemented as a one-by-one interactive quiz to simulate exam conditions and provide active recall practice. GOAL: Inform - The glossary is made interactive with a live search filter for quick lookup. Library/Method: Chart.js for the fee chart. All other visuals and interactions are built with HTML/CSS/Tailwind and vanilla JavaScript. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
