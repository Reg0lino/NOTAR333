## What is NotaREEE?

NotaREEE is a free, interactive, and gamified web application designed to help you cram for and pass the **New York State Notary Public License Exam**. It's built with a focus on "Pawsitive Reinforcement," turning the tedious process of studying into a fun and rewarding experience.

This tool is fully updated with the latest information relevant for the **June 2025 NYS Notary Exam**, including critical topics like Electronic Notarization (REN) and mandatory journal requirements.

### ‚ñ∫ Key Features: The "Pawsitive Reinforcement" Engine

This isn't just another practice test. NotaREEE is built with a smart learning engine designed to maximize your study efficiency.

- **üß† Smart Weak Spot Tracking:** The app doesn't just tell you what you got wrong; it learns *what you struggle with most*. The "Review Weak Spots" mode uses a weighted algorithm to show you your personal "nemesis" questions more frequently, ensuring you master the toughest topics.
- **üèÜ Achievement-Based Rewards:** Unlock over 15 unique achievements for performance, persistence, and accuracy. Each "Cheevo" grants you bonus points and unlocks new cat mascots for your collection.
- **üòª The Cat-alog:** Collect a crew of unique, AI-generated cat mascots! Customize your app header by choosing up to 5 of your favorite unlocked cats to be your study companions.
- **‚ú® Visual & Haptic Feedback:** Designed for a modern, mobile-first experience. With sound effects removed, the app provides satisfying haptic feedback (vibrations) for correct answers, incorrect answers, and major achievements.
- **üöÄ Celebration Loops:** Experience a full-screen "Rank Up" celebration with particle effects and your special `celebrating_cat.gif` when you reach new point milestones.
- **üé® Customizable Themes:** Choose from 6 different synthwave-inspired color themes to match your mood.
- **üìä User Dashboard:** Track your progress with a re-take the full exam.

### ‚ñ∫ Who is this for?

-   First-time test takers.
